### ADD WORKPLACES, SCHOOLS AND SUCH to different knowledge, ability or proficiency fields. example add metalworking companies, metalworker and metalworker school to metalworking proficiency
### a specialization inside of that proficiency may equal to or require or benefit from a specialization in studies. A doctorate in some specific tech field, for example.




different ways that nodes can be connected in cooking:

- ingredients
- where is the dish from
- what kind of dish is it
- how is the main ingredient prepared (cooked, grilled, baked, etc)


example - what kind of hierarchy will these rice dishes be in:
- italian risotto (risotto rice, italy, main dish, cooked?)
- sushi (sushi rice, japan, main/side?, cooked)
- karjalanpiirakka (porridge rice, finland, snack/side, cooked)
- fried rice (any?, asian countries, main, fried)


makes most sense to categorize according to main ingredient? as in:
rice -> what kind of rice (risotto rice) -> what kind of dish (risotto) -> what kind of risotto (mushroom) -> italian version or variant from east africa -> recipe

sushi main ingredient? sushi rice? maybe? i guess.
