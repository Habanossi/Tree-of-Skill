Contacts as a personal resource can be defined into different categories depending on what kind of influence they have the potential to give you. The more powerful, famous, rich etc, the better. This is now purely from an objective standpoint - how powerful people do you know that you could use to your personal gain? In reality it might not be that straightforward, unless you're a psychopath. It is still a fun thought experiment. If you're buddies with Elon Musk or some Saudi prince, you have a higher chance of profiting/benefiting of that relationship compared to knowing a random homeless guy (until you learn to know him and learn that they want to give you a billion dollars).

Be aware that basing all your personal relationships around this concept is not a good idea.
