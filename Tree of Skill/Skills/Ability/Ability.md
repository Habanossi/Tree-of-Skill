#toplevel 
When it comes to abilities, they can be rated from 0-5 but the reasoning behind a certain rating is quite objective. Experience in doing bodyweight planks doesn't help if you today can't hold it for 20 seconds.

0: Never done the thing
1: Bad at the thing
2: Mediocre at the thing
3: Good at the thing
4: Really good at the thing
5: Mastered the thing
