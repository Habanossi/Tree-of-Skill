The goal of this project is to have an expanded tree visualization of everything that is life. 
The folder structure can be used for general note-taking, but at some point, the hope is that the tree would give a visualization of what one has achieved, what one knows, masters and could be the next step, the next goal.
Just as a skill tree in a video game, you can track your previous progress and get a sense of what you need to do in order to progress to the next level, to the next skill in that skill line.

The skills category has been divided into three subcategories: Ability, Proficiency and Knowledge. 
The idea is that Abilities are skills that require physical exertion - Abilities focus on you using your body. Skills like swimming, judo and weightlifting are Abilities.
Knowledge is theoretical. Mastering Knowledge skills requires you to use your brain and learn things by heart. Reading, writing, mathematics, history, biology, languages, etc.
Proficiency is somewhere in the middle, covering skills that require knowledge to do, and using your body to do it (without needing to train your body). Cooking, driving, singing are examples of Proficiencies.
